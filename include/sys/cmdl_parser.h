 *  \brief  Command line parser.
 *
 *  The command line parser can extract certain data fields out of a character
 *  string and assign values to variables. It has 2 main functions. One to parse
 *  a command line in the form of standard C runtime "argc" and "argv" parameters,
 *  and the other to assemble these parameters reading text lines from a file in
 *  case the C runtime does not provide them.

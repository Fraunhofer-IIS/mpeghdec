/** \file   wav_file.h
 *  \brief  Rudimentary WAVE file read/write support.
 *
 *  The WAVE file reader/writer is intented to be used in the codec's example
 *  framework for easily getting started with encoding/decoding. Therefore
 *  it serves mainly for helping quickly understand how a codec's API actually
 *  works.
 *  Being a WAVE file reader/writer with very basic functionality, it may not be
 *  able to read WAVE files that come with unusual configurations.
 *  Details on how to use the interface functions can be found in every
 *  (encoder/decoder) example framework.
